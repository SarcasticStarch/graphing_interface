instructions:

1. First the newest version of Python must be installed as well as some sort of IDE, I use Pycharm.
      python installation: https://www.python.org 
      pycharm installation: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/
      
2. **Open the graphing_interface folder as the pycharm project** this is very important. In order to do this click "open" and navigate to the wherever the graphing_interface is downloaded. open the folder as the project. 

3. Open the setup.py file in pycharm and run it. If you do not see the green run button, there should be a something that says, "No Python interpreter configured for this project". If this is the case, click on "Configure Python interpreter". Click the dropdown menu that says, "<No interpreter>". If there is an option that says Python 3.7 select it and hit OK. If it is not displayed there, click the gear icon, then hit add, and locate python in your directory, then hit OK. You should now be able to run the file.

   ***If the computer is old running this file may result in error messages rather than a proper download. If this is the case, download Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=52685 and OpenSSL                 from https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html

4. After setup/py has successfully finished running, the program should be ready to run. Place all of the files that you want to read into the corresponding folder, then open run the file in that folder. For example, if you want to graph three Delta R files, copy them all into the Delta R folder, then open and run Delta_R_DataCollection.py. 

If you have any issues downloading or using the software feel free to contact me,
